     * Adapter pattern 
     * works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.
     * Adapter design pattern (often referred to as the wrapper pattern or simply a wrapper) translates one interface for a class into a compatible interface.
       An adapter allows classes to work together that normally could not because of incompatible interfaces, by providing its interface to clients while using the original interface.

     * Strategy Pattern
     * It can be considered in a kind of scenario where your object would perform a common action and that too selecting from various options available.
     * Example:
     *  sorting
     *  Robots
